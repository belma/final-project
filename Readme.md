## Scenario
The point of departure:   data set containing properties with different key parameters containing descriptive information about  location , size, pice and special features like view and numbers of rooms. 

## Objective
Exploration of the data with python, describing interesting findings in Plots and in Tableau. 

## Dataset
All the necessary files, as well as the dataset, can be found in the following repository: [**Mid-bootcamp project - Regression**](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/data_mid_bootcamp_project_regression).

The dataset consists of information on 22,000 properties. The dataset consists of historic data of houses sold between _May 2014_ to _May 2015_.

These are the definitions of data points provided:

_Note: For some of the variables are self-explanatory, no definition has been provided._

-   **Id**: Unique identification number for the property
-   **date**: the date the house was sold
-   **price**: the price of the house
-   **waterfront**: the house which has a view to a waterfront
-   **condition**: How good the condition is (Overall). 1 indicates worn-out property and 5 excellent.
-   **grade**: Overall grade given to the housing unit, based on the King County grading system. 1 poor, 13 excellent.
-   **Sqft_above**: square footage of house apart from the basement
-   **Sqft_living15**: Living room area in 2015(implies-- some renovations) This might or might not have affected the lotSize area.
-   **Sqft_lot15**: lotSize area in 2015(implies-- some renovations)

## Outcomes

### 1. Exploring the data with Python
To **explore the data**, techniques that have been discussed in class will be used. 
 - describe method
 - checking null values,
 - using Matplotlib and Seaborn for developing visualizations
 -  **data cleaning** 
 - **data pre-processing** (scaling numerical variables and encoding categorical variables)
 
### 2. Creating a DB in MySql
- answer the Questions in  [SQL Questions file](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/data_mid_bootcamp_project_regression/blob/master/sql_questions_regression.md)
- import results of sql queries for further visualisation in python

### 3. Visualisation
**Tableau** used to visually explore the data further. The questions have been provided [in this file](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/data_mid_bootcamp_project_regression/blob/master/tableau_regression.md)
