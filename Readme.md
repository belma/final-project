- checking null values,
- using Matplotlib and Seaborn for developing visualizations
-  **data cleaning**
-  **data pre-processing** (scaling numerical variables and encoding categorical variables)

### 2. Clustering for recommender 
 - Kmeans
 - DBSCAN
 - Agglomerative Clustering

### 3. Building the recommender and deploy app
**Streamlit** used to deploy the recommender app
